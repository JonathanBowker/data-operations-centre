# File format: each line is of the form
#
# <port_range>[,<port_range>...][:[<proto>[,<proto>[...]]]]
#
# where <port_range> is of the form
#
# <port>[-<port>]
#
# where <port> is a (numeric) port to probe,
# and <proto> is a lowercase string specifying a
# protocol to be tested on the specified port range(s).
#
# Port ranges may overlap, in which case all protocols
# specified are tested on ports in the overlapping ranges.
# Ports are probed in the order of first appearance, and
# for each port, protocols are also probed in the order
# of first appearance (i.e., specifying a port more than once
# will not cause repeated probes of that port, and
# specifying a protcol more than once for any port will
# not cause repeated probes of that protocol on the same port).
#
# Comments are introduced by '#' and continue to the
# end of the line
#
# Examples:
#
# # Check whether ports 6000-6009 are open (no protocol check):
# 6000-6009
#
# # Try HTTP on various ports:
# 80,8000-8008,8080,8081:http
#
# # Add a test of HTTPS to ports 80 and 8080 (but not the others):
# 80,8080:https

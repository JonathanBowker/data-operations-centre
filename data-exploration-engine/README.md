# Data Exploration Engine 

The Data Exploration Engine is a powerful indexing, search and analysis, reporting, monitoring and alerting platform. Managed feeds are loaded to the Data Explorer index so users can analyse and cross reference data and build realtime monitoring and alerting models. The Data Explorer provides artificial intelligence assisted research of the FX Knowledge Graph.

Data Exploration Engine provides detailed reporting including:

•	**Investment Factor Changes report:** This currency-specific report displays investment factor changes information between given dates

•	**Weight reports:** These reports display the security’s weight as a percentage in the composition of the selected Benchmark, on a specified date.

## Benefits

•	Supporting best practice data governance by providing full control over the access and use of the data with access roles and field level security.

By centralising the management of all the data sources with specially designed and managed data models, we provide artificial intelligence powered research and build client specific realtime market Knowledge Graphs at the microstructure level of the FX market.

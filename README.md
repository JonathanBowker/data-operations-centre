# Welcome to the Data Operations Centre

The [Data Operations Centre](http://dataoperationscentre.com/) (DOC) is wholly owned by [Innovative Integrations](http://innovativeintegrations.co.uk/) Ltd and is the channel through which it provides integrated data application development and operations (DataOps). The DOC is powered by the [ETHELÂ® Cloud](http://innovativeintegrations.co.uk/ethel-cloud.html#ethel-cloud-overview), a data operations management platform for microservices that orchestrates data flow through a stack of big data technologies to extract insight for business needs, and enhance connectivity of data for collaboration and innovation.

We have identified the inadequacies in operating at the macrostructure level of the FX market and a requirement to extend operations beyond the macrostructure to the more granular microstructure level. We also recognise that adapting to this new paradigm creates a set of challenges for investment managers, their data operations and legacy systems. 

To provide access at the microstructure level and process automation capability we have developed a [Global Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/JonathanBowker/data-operations-centre/tree/master/global-knowledge-graph), a suite of [Managed Data Services](https://github.com/JonathanBowker/data-operations-centre/tree/master/managed-services) and a [Data Exploration Engine](https://github.com/JonathanBowker/data-operations-centre/tree/master/data-exploration-engine) to search, analyse, monitor and alert on connected market events.

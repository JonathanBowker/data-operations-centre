# Global Knowledge Graph

The Global Knowledge Graph is the nexus of benchmark data, reference data and supplemental data. These Global Knowledge Graph builds relationships between benchmark rates forward and spot, interest rate differentials, economic updates, influencer opinions, societal events and other specified data. The Global Knowledge Graph continuously creates intuitive relationships between historic, current and projected indexes that can be examined and monitored for a wide range of applications. 

## 1.  Benchmark data node
The [Benchmark Data Node](https://github.com/JonathanBowker/data-operations-centre/blob/master/global-knowledge-graph/supplemental-data/README.md)  provides timestamped live Benchmark rates  ........ 

## 2.  Reference data node
The [Reference Data Node](https://github.com/JonathanBowker/data-operations-centre/blob/master/global-knowledge-graph/supplemental-data/README.md) provides timestamped live spots rates and forward premiums and discounts through a series of microservices that calculate forward rates and points and interest rate differentials in realtime and outputs the stream to destination systems, application flows and the Global Knowledge Graph. 

## 3. Supplemental data node
The [Supplemental Data Node](https://github.com/JonathanBowker/data-operations-centre/blob/master/global-knowledge-graph/supplemental-data/README.md) provides timestamped unstructured contextual data from multiple sources and processes the data through Natural Language Processing algorithms to facilitate overall decision making for a trader. The resulting machine readable data is delivered it to destination systems, application flows and the Global Knowledge Graph.

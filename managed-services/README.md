# Benchmark Data Microservice 

The Benchmark Data Microservice prepares Benchmark data feeds for specific systems or applications flows and guarantees delivery without data loss. 

## Benchmark Microservice Workflow:

•	Fully managed data workflow covering all the elements of good data processing and delivers fully validated, reformatted, customised data that is ready for consumption by in-house processes and third-party systems.

•	Complex benchmark data is handled efficiently with our customisation templates and blending routines by data vendor, source and currency pair

•	Unparalleled breadth and depth of data coverage, with quality data from over 150 data sources 

### Benchmark Microservice Benefits:

•	**Increase quality and appropriateness of data.** Specialist expertise delivers each benchmark accurately and completely for systems requirements

•	**Accelerate timeliness of key data.** Deliver important data faster for critical functions

•	**De‐risk your data operations.** Our Benchmark Data Microservice removes ongoing burdens of complex data validation and workflow management

•	**Scalable.** The Benchmark Data Microservice absorbs complexity and increasing volumes of index and benchmark data

•	**Reduce Total Cost of Data Ownership (TCO).** Streamlines data management to reduce operations costs, and minimises internal costs of data management 

•	**Governance.** Enhance control and transparency in operational processes and limits regulatory risks

# Reference Data Microservice

The Reference Data Microservice extracts, validates and transforms reference data according to specifications for specific and delivers it to destination systems and application flows.

## Reference Microservice Workflow:

•	**Data Sources**: Manage the compiling of multiple alternative data sources including: custom web crawling, machine readable news, economic updates, regulatory updates, investment banks or brokers, hedge funds, custodians and fund administrators in addition to over 10,000 reference data sources from our data partners.

•	**Validate and Remediate**: Our rigorous three level data checking routine ensures the data you receive is validated and, where necessary, remediated directly with data partners. The criteria for validation and remediation are customised according to target system specifications, asset or data type

•	**Transform**: Work closely with system vendors to ensure that we are able to combine, normalise, and cross reference all data flows and sources to ensure data meets required system specifications

•	**Feed Loading**: Loads data feeds directly into destination systems for immediate consumption.  

•	**Store**: Stores copies of each feed within a DOC repository with a range of ways to access them.

•	**Monitor**: Full visibility into data received through the Graph Explorer Application, providing a unified platform to facilitate best practice data governance.

## Reference Microservice Benefits:

•	**Consistent quality** -  Ensure more consistent, high-quality reference data with centralised validation and quality control.

•	**Timely delivery ** - Improve timely delivery of data that is genuinely end user ready.

•	**Scalability** -  process increasing volumes of complex data without incremental investment in technology or people.

•	**24/7 management** -  Dedicated team of data specialists can monitor feeds 24/7 and proactively addresses and resolves errors.

# Feed Management Microservice

The Feed Management Microservice creates an instance of the data files received from Data Microservices as part of our managed data service and archives them in a secure cloud based repository. A chronological archive of benchmark and reference data files is built over time, ensuring a definitive and accessible audit trail of all files received from the DOC.

Access to the repository is easy through a browser based interface, which allows instances of archived feeds to be searched and analysed by time and retrievable on demand on a self service basis. Selected data files, identical in content and format to the files originally received from the DOC, can be downloaded directly to desktops for further analysis and data issue investigations. 

## Benefits

•	**Regulatory compliance:** To meet the emerging & established regulatory demands for data auditing

•	**Improved data governance:** Access to a trusted source of ‘as-delivered’ data enabling easy evidence of data provenance

•	**Improved traceability:** Through a secure archive and tools that evidence the lineage of your data feeds

•	**Greater efficiency:** Less time spent requesting and waiting for the relevant data to be retrieved from internal databases, enabling faster troubleshooting

•	**Greater insight:** Quick understanding of how key aspects of your FXOC data have changed over time

•	**Better service to internal data owners:** Enables faster response time to client or stakeholder data queries

•	**Greater reliability:** Along with your internal data back-up and storage practices, FXOC Feed Audit adds another level of confidence that the data you need will be there when you need it, and accessible quickly, easily and at any time.

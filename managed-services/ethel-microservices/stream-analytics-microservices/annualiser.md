The FX Operations Centre (FXOC) is a brand wholly owned by [Innovative Integrations](http://innovativeintegrations.co.uk/) Ltd and is the channel through which we provide integrated software development and operations (DevOps) linked directly to the live nexus of the FX market.  

The FXOC has identified a requirement to move operations away from the inadequacy of the macrostructure level of the FX market to the more precise streaming microstructure level, but adapting to this new paradigm poses a series of complex challenges for existing processes and legacy systems. 

In recognition of these challenges and to support a smoother transition from macro to micro analysis and the research and development of automated processes, the FXOC has developed a times series FX Graph Engine powered by ETHELÂ® to provide containerised environments for testing and running graph models that connect disparate data in realtime.

# Feed Management Microservice

The Feed Management Microservice creates an instance of the data files received from Data Microservices as part of our managed data service and archives them in a secure cloud based repository. A chronological archive of benchmark and reference data files is built over time, ensuring a definitive and accessible audit trail of all files received from the DOC.

Access to the repository is easy through a browser based interface, which allows instances of archived feeds to be searched and analysed by time and retrievable on demand on a self service basis. Selected data files, identical in content and format to the files originally received from the DOC, can be downloaded directly to desktops for further analysis and data issue investigations.
